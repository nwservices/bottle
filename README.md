Bottle
======
A minimalistic css framework for web development.

I love bootsrap css, foundation css and even pure css, but somehow i find them a bit heavy for most of my applications and i feel they have become routeen/dull because of its implementation on most of the web apps in market. So i have built my css to keep things minimal and different in presentation. Here is my css sheet, with only frequently used elements. Try it and do give your feedback :) This code is licenced under GNU GPL V2.
